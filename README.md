I have been solving a coding problem where I must:

- Extract a series of Unicode characters and their Cartesian coordinates from a linked Google Doc;
- Use these coordinates to find out where on a 2D grid the Unicode characters go;
- Print out the characters with their associated coordinates to get the originally intended alphabetical character.

This notebook goes into greater detail for all the functions I used to achieve these goals.
